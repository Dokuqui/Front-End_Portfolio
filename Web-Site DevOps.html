         <p>DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools,
         DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for
         improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.<br />
         Apparu autour de 2007 en Belgique avec Patrick Debois, le mouvement Devops se caractérise principalement par
         roposals to combine software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts began to appear
         in the late 80s and early 90s.<br />
         Around 2007 and 2008, concerns were raised by those within the software development and IT communities that the
         separation between the two industries, where one wrote and created software entirely separate from those that
         deploy and support the software was creating a fatal level of dysfunction within the industry.<br />
         In 2009, the first conference named DevOps Days was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded
         by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois. The conference has now spread
         to other countries.<br />
         In 2012, a report called “State of DevOps” was first published by Alanna Brown at Puppet Labs. As of 2014, the annual
         State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others. They stated that the adoption
         of DevOps was accelerating. Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing
         a chapter on testing and DevOps.<br />
         In 2016, the DORA metrics for throughput (deployment frequency, lead time for changes), and stability (mean time to recover, change
         failure rate) were published in the State of DevOps report.<br />

              <li>Version Control Tool: Git 
                 <ul>
                     <li>GitHub</li>
                     <li>Gitlab</li>
                     <li>Bitbucket</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>

         <p>Git is perhaps the best and most widely used version control tool in a development 
          era characterized by dynamism and collaboration. Version control provides developers
          with a means by which they can keep track of all the changes and updates in their codes
          such that in the event of a mishap,it is quite easy to return to and use the previous
          versions of the code and Git happens to be the best for many reasons. Git DevOps tool 
          is easy to implement as it is compatible with most protocols including HTTP, SSH, and FTP.
          It offers the best advantage for non-linear shared-repository development projects, unlike
          most other centralized version control tools. This makes it a good deal for mission-critical
          software. Git features three storage tools including, GitHub and GitLab cloud-hosted code
          repository services as well as BitBucket the source code hosting service. Of the three, GitLab
          and BitBucket are specifically designed for enterprise-range version control.

         <p>
          Maven is one of the important DevOps tools for building projects. Unlike the ANT build system,
          Apache Maven is more than just an automation build framework. It is also designed to manage reporting,
          documentation, distribution, releases, and dependencies processes. Written in Java language, Maven can
          build and manage projects written in Java or C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages using project object
          model (POM) plugins. Maven offers a host of benefits to its users. It eases the build and monitoring process
          through automation and maintains a uniform build process allowing for consistency and efficiency. This tool 
          also offers comprehensive project information through quality documentation, a valuable resource for the development
          of best practices hence the name Maven, translated from the Yiddish language to mean accumulator of knowledge.
          Finally, Maven provides a very simplified feature migration process. It has a rich repository of plugins to
          enhance the build process and wide compatibility with IDEs like Eclipse, JBuilder, MyEclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA,
          and others.

                       <li>Jenkins</li>

          <p>
          Jenkins is an integration DevOps tool. For continuous integration (CI), Jenkins stands out as it is designed for both internal and plugin extensions. Jenkins is an open-source Java-based automation CI server 
          that is supported by multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and other Unix OSs. Jenkins can also be deployed on cloud-based platforms. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are two core 
          practices of the DevOps methodology which makes Jenkins an indispensable DevOps tool. Jenkins is compatible with most CI/CD integration tools and services thanks to the over 1,500 plugins available to provide 
          integration points for delivering customized functionality during software development. A valuable automation CI tool, Jenkins is pretty easy to install and configure. It is designed to support distributed workflows
          for accelerated and transparent builds, tests, and deployments across platforms.
